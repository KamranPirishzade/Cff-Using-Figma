        <p class="text1">
            Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels. 
            But you learn to read books in school,
            but you don't learn to watch movies. And without preparation,
            it can be difficult to enjoy watching a movie.
        </p>
        <p class="text2">
        In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious viewers. 
        We will get acquainted with the stages of film production and learn how to watch a moviethrough the eyes of a screenwriter,
        director and editor. We will understand genres and look at the most important films,from Citizen Kane to The Matrix.
